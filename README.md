# 🚀 Embedded C Daily Dose

## 30-Day Embedded C & Firmware Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my **30-day intensive learning journey** into the world of embedded systems, firmware development, and low-level programming! This repository chronicles my progression from foundational concepts to advanced embedded systems implementations.

---

## 📖 About This Journey

This repository represents a **structured, progressive learning path** where each day builds upon the previous one. The projects demonstrate continuous skill growth and deepening understanding of embedded systems concepts, from basic C programming to complex firmware implementations.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **Master Embedded C Programming**: From syntax to advanced memory management and optimization
- **Understand Hardware-Software Interface**: Direct hardware manipulation, registers, and peripherals
- **Develop Real-World Firmware**: Bare-metal programming, device drivers, and communication protocols
- **Build IoT Applications**: Arduino and ESP32 projects with sensors, WiFi, BLE, and cloud connectivity
- **Apply Best Practices**: Code organization, documentation, debugging, and version control

---

## 🛠️ Project Categories

This journey encompasses three interconnected domains:

### 1. **Standalone C Programs**
- Data structures and algorithms optimized for embedded systems
- System programming concepts (memory management, file I/O, process control)
- Performance optimization and resource-constrained programming

### 2. **Embedded Firmware (Bare-Metal)**
- Direct register manipulation and hardware control
- Custom device drivers (GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, PWM)
- Interrupt handling and real-time constraints
- Communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C, CAN)
- Low-power modes and power management

### 3. **Arduino & ESP32 Projects**
- Sensor interfacing (temperature, humidity, motion, light)
- Wireless communication (WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy)
- IoT cloud integration (MQTT, HTTP APIs)
- Real-time data processing and visualization
- Advanced peripherals (displays, motors, actuators)

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each day's project is contained in its own numbered folder following this format:

```
1_project_name/
├── README.md          # Project-specific documentation
├── src/               # Source code files
├── include/           # Header files (if applicable)
├── docs/              # Additional documentation, schematics, diagrams
└── ...                # Other project-specific files
```

### Folder Naming Convention
- **Format**: `<day_number>_<descriptive_project_name>/`
- **Examples**: 
  - `1_hello_embedded/`
  - `15_i2c_sensor_driver/`
  - `30_iot_weather_station/`

Each project folder contains:
- **README.md**: Detailed explanation of the project, learning objectives, hardware requirements, setup instructions, and key takeaways
- **Source code**: Well-commented implementation
- **Documentation**: Schematics, datasheets, reference materials, and notes
